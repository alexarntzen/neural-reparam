Our results settle an open question about representability in the class of single hidden layer neural networks. In particular, we show that arbitrary decision regions can be arbitrarily well approximated by continuous feedforward neural networks with only a single internal, hidden layer and any continuous sigmoidal nonlinearity. The paper discusses approximation properties of other possible types of nonlinearities that might be implemented by artificial neural networks.},

We establish new rigorous upper and lower bounds for the network complexity in the setting of approximations in Sobolev spaces. In particular, we prove that deep ReLU networks more efficiently approximate smooth functions than shallow networks. In the case of approximations of 1D Lipschitz functions we describe adaptive depth-6 network architectures more efficient than the standard shallow architecture.}

Our technique is based on the exponential representation of the elements of the group, which allows as to transfer the problem to the corresponding Lie algebra (n) and benefit from the linearity of this space. Due to the exponential representation, we can obtain a high degree of smoothness of an interpolating curve. The underlying problem is challenging because the standard SO(n) → (n) map is multivalued.}},
