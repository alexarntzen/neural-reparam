\subsection{The square root velocity transform}
We now restrict our study to curves starting at zero define the space \(\mathcal{P}_* : = \{c \in \mathcal{P}: c(0) = 0\}\). A method for imposing a metric on \(\mathcal{P}_*\), is to transform the curves with a diffeomorphism to another Riemannian manifold, then computing the corresponding pullback metric on \(\mathcal{P}\). A popular such transformation, introduced in \cite{srivastava2011_srvt}, is the \emph{square root velocity transform} (SRVT), which is given by
\begin{equation}\label{eq:SRVT}
  R :\mathcal{P} \rightarrow C^{\infty}(I, R^d \setminus \{0\}), \quad c \mapsto \frac{c'}{\sqrt{\vert c' \vert}}.
\end{equation}

The SRVT has several properties which are not proved here; for a thorough introduction see \cite{bruveris1016_srvtexample,bauer2014_rprop}. Firstly, the SRVT is invariant under translation and therefore not injective on \(\mathcal{P}\). It will however, be a diffeomorphism between \(\mathcal{P}\) nd \(C^{\infty}(I, \R^d \setminus \{0\})\)\cite{bruveris1016_srvtexample}[Theorem 1]. Between these spaces, the SRVT also has an analytical inverse on the form
\begin{equation*}
  R^{-1}(q)(t) = \int_0 ^t q \vert q\vert \,d\tau.
\end{equation*}
Furthermore, imposing the \(L^2\) inner product on\((C^{\infty}(I, R^d), \langle \cdot , \cdot \rangle_{L^2} )\) gives an inner product space. Thus, the SRVT imposes a pullback distance metric  
\begin{equation*}
  d_{\mathcal{P}_*}(c_1, c_2) = \norm{R(c_1) - R(c_2)}_{L^2}, 
\end{equation*}
and a pullback Riemannian metric, 
\begin{equation*}
  G_c(h,k) = \langle T_c R(h), T_c R(k) \rangle_{L^2}
\end{equation*}
 on \(\mathcal{P}_*\). Moreover \(G\) will be a \emph{first order Sobolev metric}, defined by the arch length integral
\begin{equation*}
  G_c(h,k) = \int_I \langle D_s h^\perp ,D_s^\perp k \rangle+\frac{1}{4}\langle D_s h,v\rangle \langle D_s k,v\rangle \,ds,
\end{equation*}
where \(ds = \vert c' \vert\,dt\), \(v = D_s c = \frac{c'}{\vert c'\vert}\) is the curve of unit length tangents of \(c\), and \(D_s h^\perp = D_s h  - \langle D_s h,v\rangle v\) is the projection of \(D_s h\) onto the space of curves orthogonal to \(v\). 

The space \(C^{\infty}(I, \R^d \setminus \{0\}) \) is a non-convex subset of an inner product space. Therefore, when the SRVT form of two curves \(R(c_1), R(c_2)\) belong to the same convex subset of \(C^{\infty}(I, \R^d \setminus \{0\})\), then the shortest path between them will be the line 
\begin{equation}
  \eta(t) = R(c_2)t +  R(c_1)(1-t). 
\end{equation} 
Therefore, the geodesics from \(c_1\) to \(c_2\) is given by
\begin{equation*}
  \gamma(t) = R^{-1}[R(c_2)t +  R(c_1)(1-t)],
\end{equation*}
and the length of \(\gamma\) will be the equal to \(d_{\mathcal{P}_*(c_1, c_2)}\). For curves which have an SRV form not connected by a line in \(C^{\infty}(I, \R^d \setminus \{0\})\) (e. g. \(c_1 = -c_2\)) the situation is more complicated.  Either the geodesic of the metric \(G\) will not exist, or the geodesic distance will not correspond to the distance \(d_{\mathcal{P}_*}\). 

When \(d \geq 3\),  we can make lines in \(C^{\infty}(I, \R^d )\) smoothly into paths in \(C^{\infty}(I, \R^d \setminus \{0\}\) by arbitrary small perturbations \cite{bauer2014_rprop}[Section 2.1]. Thus, the distance given by \(d_{\mathcal{P}_*}\) will be the geodesic distance of \(G\). However, when \(d \leq 2 \), these smooth perturbations are not always possible, and \(d_{\mathcal{P}_*}\) will not always agree with the geodesic distances induced by \(G\).  As a remedy for \(d \leq 2 \), it is possible to consider geodesic completions of \(\mathcal{P}_* \) as discussed in \cite{bruveris1016_srvtexample}[Section 2.2] and more generally in \cite{bruveris2014_geocomp}.


To extend the Riemannian geometry of \(\mathcal{P}\) to the shape space, we note by \cite{celledoni2016}that the SRVT has the equivariance property:
\begin{equation*}
  R(c \circ \varphi) = \sqrt{\varphi'}R(c) \circ \varphi \quad \forall \ \varphi \in \text{Diff}^+, c \in \mathcal{P}.
\end{equation*}
Therefore, we deduce by integration or \cite[Theorem 3.1]{bauer2014_rprop} that the metrics \(G\) and \(d_{\mathcal{P}_*}\) are reparametrization invariant. The reparametrization invariant distance can then be extended to \(\mathcal{S}_* : = \{[c] \in \mathcal{S}: c(0)=0\}\) by \eqref{eq:distance_inf}. Consequently, finding distances and geodesics between two shapes \([c_1], [c_2]\in \mathcal{S}_*\) has been reduced to finding a reparametrization \(\varphi \in \DiffI\) that minimizes
\begin{equation} \label{eq:srvt_reparam}
  \norm{R(c_1) - \sqrt{\varphi'} R(c_2)\circ \varphi}_{L^2}.
\end{equation}

The optimal solution to the optimization problem above will not necessarily exist in \(\DiffI\). Examples of curves that lead to optimal reparametrization outside \(\DiffI\) can be found in \cite[p.11]{bauer2015why} and \cite[Section 3.2]{woien2019}. One problem is that optimal solutions might have vanishing derivatives. Thus, the optimal solution is not guaranteed to be a diffeomorphism. Still, there are metrics on \(\mathcal{P}\) for which the optimal diffeomorphism is guaranteed as shown in \cite{bauer2014overview}. \citeauthor{bruveris1016_srvtexample} \cite{bruveris1016_srvtexample} instead expands the search space to
\begin{equation*}
  \overline \Gamma = \{\gamma : I \rightarrow I : \gamma \text{\ abs. \ cont. }, \gamma(0) = 0, \gamma(1) = 1, \gamma' \geq 0 \ \text{a.e.}\}.
\end{equation*}
The existence problem is then remedied by showing that for curves \(c_1, c_2 \in C^2(I,\R^d)\) there exists optimal reparametrizations \(\varphi_1^*, \varphi_2^* \in \overline{ \Gamma}\) that minimizes
\begin{equation*}
  d_{\mathcal{P}_*}(c_1 \circ \varphi_1, c_2 \circ \varphi2).
\end{equation*}
