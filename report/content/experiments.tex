There is a wide range of network structures and optimization algorithms. An in-depth search for the best parameters will not be the focus of this chapter. The main focus of this chapter will be to investigate when reparametrization by neural networks is possible and how it compares to other methods. To that end we investigate how the error evolves with increasing width and depth of the networks. If we are able to optimize the networks well, then the error should with increasing number of layers

We will however compare \emph{residal networks} (ResNets) and \emph{fully feedforward neural networks} (FFNNs). FFNN are are defined as in Definition \ref{def:FNN}, but we also require that all the parameters defined are variables that change in the optimization procedure, i.e., trainable. Futhermore, there are many different version of ResNets, but we will a simple version as follows. ResNets are defines similarly to FFNNs, but for \(L>l>1\), the layer \(f^{[l]} = \sigma \circ A_l\) is replaced by 
\begin{equation*}
   \hat f^{[l]} = \sigma \circ A_l + \id
\end{equation*} 

In the following experiments we use the BFGS algorithm with batches of size \(N/2\).  sampled uniformly without replacement \({(t_i)}_{i=1}^N\), which denotes the \(N\) equidistant points discretizing \(I\). 
% We also investigate whether the type of error is optimization error or is approximation error. Thus, by the results in chapter \ref{subsec:neural-nets}, we investigate how increasing the network size impacts the resulting error. This approach will still be somewhat ambiguous; since increasing network size simultaneously increases the dimension of the optimization problem.
