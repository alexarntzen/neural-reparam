\label{sec:appendix}
The code used in the experiments for this project can be found at \url{https://github.com/alexarntzen/neural-reparam}. The optimization procedure and neural network implementation were done with the PyTorch \cite{PyTorch} library. The networks were initialized with the PyTorch default distribution, and the optimization method used was BFGS. \todo{clean up this paragraph}
