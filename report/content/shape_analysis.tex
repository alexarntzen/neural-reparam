\section{Shape analysis}\label{sec:shape-analysis}
\subsection{Definitions and motivation}
To start the problem of analyzing curves we fist introduce the space of curves considered in this project. To that end, we will follow the approach given by \citeauthor{bauer2015why} in \cite{bauer2015why}. The curves we will consider will be the space of all immersions from the interval  \(I = [0, 1]\) to  \(\R^d\)
\begin{equation*}
  \mathcal{P}:= \text{Imm}(I, \R^d) = \{c \in C^{\infty}(I, \R^d) :  c'(t) \neq  0 \ \forall \ t \in I  \}.
\end{equation*}
This space \(\mathcal{P}\) is generally called the \emph{pre-shape space}. Although we will restrict ourselves to the study of open curves, analysis of closed curves \(\text{Imm}(S^1, \R^d)\) and surfaces \(\text{Imm}(I \times I, \R^d)\) has also been investigated with a similar framework \cite{bauer2014overview}.

We would like to study shapes, i.e. curves independent on their parametrization. More precisely, we consider the space of all reparametrizations \(\varphi\) as the group of orientation preserving diffeomorphisms of \(I\)
\begin{equation*}
  \text{Diff}^+(I) = \{\varphi \in C^{\infty}(I,I): \varphi(0) = 0, \varphi(1) = 1, \varphi'(t) > 0 \ \forall \ t \in I \}.
\end{equation*}
The group action 
\begin{equation}
  \psi : \DiffI \times \mathcal{P} \rightarrow \mathcal{P},\quad \psi(\phi, c) \mapsto c \circ \phi 
\end{equation}
can then be used to construct the \emph{shape space} \(\mathcal{S}\) as the quotient space under this group action,
\begin{equation*}
  \mathcal{S} := \mathcal{P} \ / \ {\text{Diff}^+(I)}.
\end{equation*}
The space \(\mathcal{S}\) is also an infinite-dimensional manifold with elements called \emph{shapes}.

\subsection{Distance on shape space}
To find a distance function \(d_{\mathcal{S}}\) on \(\mathcal{S}\) we start with a distance on \(\mathcal{\mathcal{P}}\) that is \emph{reparametrization invariant}. That is, \(d_\mathcal{P} : \mathcal{P} \times P \rightarrow (0, \infty)\) has the property that for all  \(c_1, c_2 \in \mathcal{P}\)
\begin{equation*}
  d_{\mathcal{P}}(c_1, c_2)=d_{\mathcal{P}}(c_1 \circ \varphi, c_2\circ \varphi) \quad \forall \varphi \in \text{Diff}^+.
\end{equation*}

A reparametrization invariant distance function on \(\mathcal{P}\) is not enough to define a distance function on \(\mathcal{S}\) directly. Instead, a distance function on \(\mathcal{S}\) is given by 
\begin{equation}
  d_\mathcal{S} ([c_1],[c_2]) := \inf_{\varphi \in \text{Diff}^+}{  d_{\mathcal{P}}(c_1,c_2 \circ \varphi)},
  \label{eq:distance_inf}
\end{equation}
where  \([c_1]\) and  \([c_2]\) are the shapes with representatives \(c_1\) and  \(c_2\). Furthermore, this distance function on \(\mathcal{S}\) is well defined by \cite{celledoni2016}[Lemma 3.4].


\subsection{Riemannian metrics on shape space}
As remarked in \cite{bauer2014overview}, the the shape space \(\mathcal{S}\) is inherently non-linear. Therefore we impose a Riemannian metric  on \(\mathcal{P}\). Furthermore, we require that the Riemannian metric is reparametrization invariant. That is, a Riemannian metric \(G\) such that for all \( c \in \mathcal{P}\) and \(h,k \in  T_c \mathcal{P} = C^\infty(I, \R^d) \)
\begin{equation*}
  G_c(h,k) = G_{c \circ \varphi}(h\circ \varphi, k \circ \varphi) \quad \forall \varphi \in \text{Diff}^+.
\end{equation*}
It can then be shown that a reparametrization invariant Riemannian metric will  induce a reparametrization invariant distance on \(\mathcal{P}\) given by
\begin{equation*}
  d_\mathcal{P}(c_1, c_2) = \inf_{
    \substack{
      \gamma \in C^{\infty}([0,1], \mathcal{P}) \\
      \gamma(0) = c_1 \\
      \gamma(1) = c_2
    }
  } \int_0^1 \sqrt{G_{\gamma(t)}(\gamma'(t),\gamma'(t))} \, dt.
\end{equation*}
Therefore, a well defined distance on \(\mathcal{S}\) can be obtained by \eqref{eq:distance_inf}. 
%The Riemannian metric on \(\mathcal{P}\) also defines a unique Riemannian metric on \(\mathcal{S}\) such that the projection map from \(\mathcal{P}\) to \(\mathcal{S}\) is a Riemannian submersion \cite[Section 6]{bauer2014_rprop}.\todo{fix this}

An obvious metric on \(\mathcal{P}\) is the \(L^2\) metric  given by
\begin{equation*}
  G_c(h,k) = \int_I \langle h, k\rangle \vert c'\vert \,dt.
\end{equation*}
However, as shown in \cite{michor2003vanishingl2} and \cite{michor2004vanishing_generalized} the \(L^2\) metric induces a vanishing distance on shape space \(\mathcal{S}\). This means that for any \(c_1, c_2 \in \mathcal{P}\) we can construct curves \(\gamma \in C^{\infty}([0,1],\mathcal{P})\) starting at \(c_1\) ending at \(c_2 \circ \varphi\) of arbitrary short length. As a conclusion the \(L^2\) metric is useless for comparing shapes, and so we are bound to fined another metric.
